* pygraphviz (For visualizing Finite State Machine)
    * [Setup pygraphviz on Ubuntu](http://www.jianshu.com/p/a3da7ecc5303)

### Secret Data

`WEBHOOK_URL` in app.py **MUST** be set to proper values.
Otherwise, you might not be able to run your code.

### Run Locally
You can either setup https server or using `ngrok` as a proxy.

**`ngrok` would be used in the following instruction**

```sh
./ngrok http 5000
```

After that, `ngrok` would generate a https URL.

You should set `WEBHOOK_URL` (in app.py) to `your-https-URL/hook`.
